# Intelligent Photovoltaic System with Solar Tracking

## Description
This mini-project involves the development of an intelligent photovoltaic system that can automatically track the sun to optimize electricity production. The system also monitors several electrical and environmental parameters.

## Architecture
- **Arduino UNO**: controls the movement of the solar panel  
- **ESP8266**: collects and transmits sensor data  

## Sensors
- Light intensity  
- Electrical current  
- Temperature and humidity  
- Dust  

## Display
Data is transmitted in real-time to a **smartphone** via the **Blynk** app, allowing simple and effective monitoring.

## Hardware
Arduino UNO, ESP8266, solar panels, motors, various sensors.
